== Azure Databricks ==

Apache Spark
============
Apache Spark is developed on top of Hadoop to replace MapReduce
	open source
	Simple and easy API's
	in-memory processing
	Distributed computing platform
	Unified engine which supports SQL, streaming, ML and graph processing

Spark Architecture

SparkSQL
SparkStreaming
SparkML
Spark Graph
DataFrame/Dataset API

Spark SQL Engine
	Catalyst optimizer
	Tungsten
Spark Core
	Scala
	Python
	Java
	R
	RDD's(resilient distributed dataset's)
Spark Standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes

Databricks
=========
 clusters
 workspace/notebooks
 Administration on controls
 Optimized Spark
 Databases/Tables
 Delta Lake
 SQL Analytics
 ML Flow

Databricks available on all main cloud platforms GCP/AWS/Azure, but Databricks on Azure is unified with Azure cloud

unified azure portal+ unified billing
Data services == data lake, blob storage, cosmos DB, SQl Database, synapse
Messaging Services = IOT Hub, Event Hub
Power BI
Azure ML
Azure Data Factory
Azure Active Directory
Azure Devops

Databricks clusters

what is databricks cluster
cluster types
cluster configuration
creating cluster
pricing
cost control
cluster pools
cluster policy

Databricks cluster
collection of multiple vms 
Driver vm/node
worker vm's/nodes

cluster types

all purpose 	|	job cluster
====================================
created manually	created by job
persistent		terminated at the end of the job
Suitable for interactive suitable for automated workloads 
workloads
shared among many users	isolated just for the job
expensive to run	cheaper to run

cluster configurations
	single/multi Node 
	access mode
		single user
		 only one use access supports python, sql, scala, r
		shared 
		 only available in premium. supports python, sql.
		no isolation shared
		 multiple user access supports python, sql, scala, R
		Custom
		 legacy config
	Databricks runtime
		databricks runtime
			spark, scala, java, python, r, ubantu libraries, gpu libraries, delta lake, other db services
		databricks runtime ml
			everything from databricks runtime, popular ML libraries(pytorch, keras, tensorflow, xgboost etc)
		photon runtime
			everything from db runtime, photon engine
		databricks runtime light
			runtime only for only jobs not requiring advanced features
	Auto termination
		terminates the cluster after X minutes of inactivity
		Defalut value for single node and standard cluster in 120 min
		users can specify a value between 10 and 100000 mins as the duration

	Auto scaling
		users specifies the min and max work nodes
		auto scales between min and max based on the workload
		not recommended for streaming workloads
	Cluster VM types/size
		memory optimized
		compute optimized
		storage optimized
		general purpose 
		GPU accelerated
	Cluster Policy
		unrestricted
		personal compute
		simplifies the user interface
		enable standard users to create cluster
		achieves cost control
		only available on prem tier
